# React Coding Challenge: Reddit Comments

Implement a Commenting Tool, which when placed on the page should display a block with comments with threads (similar to Reddit)

## Technology used

For this challenge, I used the following Technology:

- React
- TypeScript

## App start

This is a vite project.

- To start the development server, run the following command:

  ```sh

  ```

- To build the app for production and serve the app from the dist folder, run the following command:
  ```sh
  npm run build && npm run serve
  ```
